--------  THINGS TO REWORK  --------

---  VideoCameraRig  ---
Uses a seperate camera and a canvas. Ends up working like a render texture camera
Could scale it up, put it in worldspace, idk

Screen position out of view frustum errors
Cancel fov changes on vr camera (or silence the warnings at least)

---  PauseMenu  ---
Move pause camera closer


---  Mouse Input  ---
Could try to use a controller as a pointer for the Cursor
Would have to patch/rework the Cursor

Seems to work best when the main cam is pointing perpendicular to the UI "screen"
Makes sense since thats how it'd work on flatscreen


---  Tracked Input  ---
Create a little steamvr tracking rig in Unity and port it in
Patch/rework Cursor and Interactable stuff to accept input from the VrRig



------  CABIN  ------




--------  MISC STUFF  --------

---  Cameras & UI
Most of the camera stuff (at least for GBC ones) are just a prefab,
so I could probably modify the camera stuff based off the prefab, as opposed to per scene.

Idk if I could modify the prefab itself and load that instead?

Check to see if thats true for the cabin scenes
