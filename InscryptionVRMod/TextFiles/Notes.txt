--------  THINGS TO REWORK  --------

---  VideoCameraRig  ---
Uses a seperate camera and a canvas. Ends up working like a render texture camera
Could scale it up, put it in worldspace, idk


------  CABIN  ------

---  TextDisplayer ---
Uses a seperate camera, but it's perspective and worldspace.
Just move it back if it should be on HUD.
Rescale and move to correct pos if it should be floating above the table

---  ScreenEffects --- 
Same as TextDisplayer, just move it back a little to prevent z-fighting
