VR Rig:
	✓ Fix scaling
		- Tracking root scale of 6x+ is about right
		- Account for scale in height calibration
	✓ Height Recalibration
		- Press a button to get current height and use that to find the tracking-root position
		- Maybe use it for positional calibration?
	- HL:A style boundaries when you stick your head into a wall
		- Blur screen out and point player back
		- If they're outside the playable area ramp up glitch effects too
	- GBA scene compatibility
	

VR Hands:
	- Fix BehaviourSkeleton tracking
	- In GBC sections, replace hands with a GBC styled controller
		- Have animations for button presses
	✓ Holding pickups in your hand
		- Not entirely complete
		- Would be cool to reach out and grab, not just raycast
	- Move player figurine by picking it up manually
	- Holding your deck
		- deck in left hand, draw cards/interact with right
		- grab card out of deck with right hand to play it
		- deck leaves hand, can use left hand to select sacrifices
		  (can grab deck w left hand to back out)
		- play card with right hand

Game Patches:
	- Wrap InteractionCursor so I can delete it from the scene
		- Patch cursor singleton to point to my own script?
	- Fix "Screen position out of view frustum" error
	- Fix candle flame rotation lock
	- Get pause screen to work
		- Get hands to render in front
	- Patch FPS controller to use hmd rotation for LookDirection
